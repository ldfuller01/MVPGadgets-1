### TODO
- Server Player Administration Panel; including the ability to mute, kick, tempban, and ban players. Possible dependencies. Bungeecord capability/ability to make punishments through networked servers?
- Melon Bomb (ex. The dropping/throwing of a melon and it exploding into glistening melons.)
- Flame Thrower (ex. A item exerting fire towards other players, mobs, or ground.)
- Black Hole (ex. A collection of black and grey particles to symbolize a black hole.)
